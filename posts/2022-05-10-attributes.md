Character attributes like strength, intelligence, and whatnot predate tabletop RPGs (they were part of war and miniature games from the early 1900s) and are still the most used way to establish boundaries and separation between characters - from GURPS’ classical ST, DX, HT and IQ to modern wrappings like “wits” and “blood” - It doesn’t matter which system you use, you will start the character sheet with the attributes. Much of the rest is derived from them. 

For my experimental system, I’ve been contemplating two ideas:

First: Attributes as measurement of both inborn traits as well as personality traits. In most existing systems, these attributes measure what you are, not how you behave. Having them inform personality & behavior could have some very interesting consequences:
- It could make for an unique (and hopefully fun) character creation experience, 
- It could lead to more nuanced characters,
- It opens the possibility of creating a variety of interesting new mechanics  - which leads to the second idea:

Second: Have a system where you can combine attributes to roll for a test. In my text about “skills,” I already mentioned how much I like White Wolf’s system of pairing attributes with skills for character tests: it allows for flexibility and creativity. This idea of “combining attributes” doubles down in the concept, since instead of adding an attribute + pre-defined skill, you would combine 2 attributes, one representing an “inborn” capacity and one representing a personality trait. 

## Personality and behavior

Can a personality test predict your future behavior? Billions of dollars and a whole industry of consulting, training, and testing say yes. From the more well-known Myers–Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) to the newer NEO PI-R, businesses worldwide rely on tests like these to try to predict the best new hire, build better customer experiences, etc...

Despite lacking hard scientific evidence, these systems claim to analyze a person’s personality within a couple of spectrums, giving a digest of how they would act under certain circumstances. Does this work in real life? I certainly have my reservations. But it does make for a super exciting way of creating characters!

If we assume that, in this RPG system, personality does inform behavior, we can extrapolate and say that having some scores on specific attributes corresponds to a character that had different life experiences leading to specific skill proficiencies. In other words, If you put lots of points into both your character’s strength (inborn attribute) and forcefulness (psychological attribute), they WILL be good at melee fight. 

## "Dimensions": Attributes as ranges 

The attributes that represent natural traits and the ones that represent “personality/behavior” would be laid across spectrums. I’m calling those “dimensions,” and I’m thinking 8 attributes across 4 dimensions”:

- Mental (How the character uses their brainpower),
- Physical (How the character uses their body),
- Holistic (how the character relates to themselves and the world around them)
- Decisional (What is the character’s action-taking style). 

Each dimension has two attributes representing contrasting perspectives and distinct approaches. Take the “Decisional” dimension as an example: the available attributes are forcefulness and resourcefulness. (Note that all these names are really just a first draft, I’m certainly not 100% happy with them).  
Forcefulness, as the name implies, means that a character is good at direct confrontation, while “resourcefulness” means that the character can achieve the same goals through evasion and cleverness. 

Note that one attribute is purposely NOT the opposite of the other: a character can be good at both - think more in terms of “two sides of the same coin.” If, though, a character is only good at one, it means they can only do things that one particular way. And because players have a limited pool of points, they will end up having to prioritize one side over the other, lending the character some “flavor.”

### Draft of dimensions and skills

Here’s my initial draft:

#### Mental

Mental is about How the character uses their brainpower.

Attributes: **Rational** vs. **Sensorial**

**Rational**: Is the character good at problem-solving skills, thinking about abstract ideas, and finding solutions to logical/mathematical operations and puzzles?
Or
**Sensorial**: Are they more alert to perceiving the physical world, capable of noticing fine details, recognizing patterns quickly, and solving spatial problems of navigation?

#### Physical

The Physical dimension is about how the character uses their body.

Attributes: **Might** vs. **Agility**

**Might**: Does the character make great use of strength and muscle memory?
Or
**Agility**: Do they use their bodily motions to handle objects skillfully, with excellent hand-eye coordination and precise and accurate movements?

A character with a higher score on “might” will be better at feats of strength and vigor.
A character with a high score on Agility will be more dexterous and nimble.

#### Holistic

The holistic dimension is about how the character relate to themselves and the world around them.

Attributes: **Eloquence** vs. **Inspiration**

**Eloquence**: is the character good at socializing, entertaining and influencing or persuading others?
Or
**Inspiration**: Does the character emphasize knowledge, cooperation and mutual improvement. 

A character with a high Eloquence will be able to go well in social interactions and reach their goals without violence, through charm, threats, or sensible reasoning.
A character with a high Inspiration has a better comprehension of themselves and the world.

#### Decisional

The decisional dimension covers the character’s action-taking style.

Attributes: **Force** vs. **resourceful**

**Force**: Is your character direct and confrontational? The kind that jumps straight into the action, “shot first, questions later”?
Or
**resourceful**: Do they figure out a plan to deal with the situation? The kind that is more analytical and places emphasis on doing it right?

A character with high Force is excellent at doing things that require alertness and readiness, like battle.
A character with high resourceful is great at keeping it cool and reasoning even in the face of danger.

## Mechanics

I have two dimensions representing inborn traits and two dimensions representing personality  - the idea is that skills would be based on an intersection between these two broad areas. 

I would still have a skill list that the player “buys” with points - say, “lockpicking.” But instead of being solely based on “IQ” (as in GURPS) it would be the sum of “Dexterity” (from the physical dimension) and “Resourcefulness” (from the decisional dimension).

If, though, the player wants to improvise or do something that no skill list is prepared for (Oh, the bard will enter a shepherd's pie-eating competition?), there is flexibility to let that happen as well as a system in place for the GM to use. 

In general, the GM would ask themself two questions:

1 - Which kind of inborn aptitude does this test require? (Physical or Mental?)
2 - Which kind of behavior does this test relates to? The character's world view and how they interact with others (Holystical) or how they react in the face of adversity (Decisional)?
