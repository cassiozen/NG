# Dice rolling

Rolling dice is at the core of most tabletop RPG games: When the success of your actions hangs in the balance, a dice roll determines your fortune. At the surface, it might seem like the decisions an RPG system has to make about dice revolve primarily around the type (D20? D6?) and how many. Still, when you stop to learn and think about it, it‚Äôs a whole universe: of modalities (Roll for target vs. Dice Pool), mechanics (who rolls the dice?), styles (roll under vs. roll over), the kind of information you can gather (degrees of success, for example). Even whether or not to use dice is a discussion worth having for many systems. 

Let‚Äôs tackle these one by one. 

### To use or not to use dice?
I like dice. I like randomness in the system, and dice are a convenient way of doing it.

### Who rolls the dice?
Some newer RPG systems introduced the concept that the player **always** rolls the dice, never the GM. The reasoning, as far as I understand, is that if something affects the character, then the player should roll. Tho would help create a feeling of control, ownership, or responsibility. I get it, and I do believe that small changes seemingly superficial can cause a significant gameplay impact (like roll over vs. roll under), but I don‚Äôt think this is the case here. 
In fact, I like the opposite: rolling against someone else creates a fun competition; it makes the in-game conflict embodied in a roll against the GM. It‚Äôs like card games: there are games that you can play by yourself, but the most fun are the ones you play against other people. 
So, in the end, I‚Äôll keep the ‚Äúeverybody rolls, including GM‚Äù style. 
But bringing other elements from casino games like raising the stakes? That‚Äôs an interesting idea‚Ä¶

### Rolling against target number vs. dice pools
Dice pools are another modality of dice rolling that became more prevalent in newer RPG systems (for context, ‚Äúnewer‚Äù for me means ‚Äúintroduced in the last 15 years‚Äù üòÖ). The advantage of a dice pool is that successes and failures are more immediately evident without needing to do math. But dice pools also come with their share of problems: you lose finely-grained control for bonuses and penalties, and rolling lots of dice can become cumbersome‚Ä¶ Besides, I don‚Äôt feel that math is problematic - I don‚Äôt have data to back this claim (and for certain people, even the slightest hint of math isn‚Äôt fun) but I think the bigger problem in rules-heavy games isn‚Äôt the amount of math but rather the amount of mental bookkeeping. All the bonuses you can apply, the difficulty classes you have to account for, calculating degrees of success... The problem isn‚Äôt making a sum - it‚Äôs knowing what and when to sum (and feeling secure that you know them well enough that you don‚Äôt have to keep them in a constant mental loop, which can be exhausting). 
So, for my experimental system, I‚Äôll just keep a regular dice roll where you have to sum numbers and try to beat a target - no dice pools. But I will tackle the mental bookkeeping problem - I‚Äôll talk about my ideas after covering ‚Äúroll under vs. roll over.‚Äù 

### roll under vs. roll over
from a mathematical perspective, there is no difference here - but it is one of those cases where a subtle difference causes a more noticeable impact during gameplay. 
In both models, the user rolls a die or dice trying to beat a target number. In ‚Äúroll over‚Äù systems, the user needs to roll a number equal to or higher than the target. On ‚Äúroll under‚Äù systems‚Ä¶ well, you got it, you have to roll equal or less.
But the way these models got popularized implies a different perspective during gameplay. In most roll-over systems, the GM decides on the number to beat (generally according to some difficulty scale). The user then rolls the dice and adds bonuses according to their character sheet (skills, equipment, etc., can grant bonus). It‚Äôs not a matter of looking into a number and trying to beat it. 
In contrast, in most roll under systems (GURPS included), the character‚Äôs skill value **IS** the target number. The GM might want to apply a modifier if the situation is especially difficult, and that changes the target number, but when the user rolls, there‚Äôs nothing to add or subtract - all they need to do is best that target. 
It‚Äôs a subtle difference, but knowing at all times what is the number that you need to beat makes it that much more fun - When you‚Äôre ready to roll, your brain is entirely in ‚Äúcheering and wishing mode‚Äù - the same kind of anticipation you feel watching sports, the moment before the kick. There are no numbers to consider, no bonuses to apply, you either score, or you don‚Äôt. 
‚ÄúOh, but rolling under is so unintuitive‚Äù - I heard a million times. What I can tell is that I did watch my fair share of new GURPS players forgetting that, then going through a-ha moments of ‚Äúoh yeah, I need to roll UNDER!‚Äù, but that lasts very little, and eventually, everybody gets over it. 


### Which dice, and how many?
Different and adorned dice sets are seen as an embodiment of tabletop RPGs. The colectionist appeal of those shiny, jewel-like objects is undeniable - I am guilty myself of having spent more money than rationally reasonable on these pieces of plastic. So yeah, emotionally, I would slap a D20 on the system and call the day. But here‚Äôs the thing - the number of dice you use influences gameplay. If you‚Äôre using a single D20, for example, the chances of rolling a given number are always the same: one in twenty. If you add more dice, though, the results get distributed in a bell curve - within 3 D6, for example, there‚Äôs only one single combination that gives you a sum of 18: three sixes. But 27 different possible combinations give you a sum of 10. This bell curve is desirable because it makes the extremes happen less frequently - I can guarantee you that a critical success in GURPS is much more celebrated by the players than a natural 20 in D&D. 

So a thousand words in just to say I‚Äôll do everything just like GURPS does? Well, at the bare minimum it shows that the decisions Steve Jackson made over 30 years ago when he wrote GURPS stood the test of time. 
But there are two things about dice mechanics that I think could use improvements in GURPS. First, it does a less-than-great job on defining degrees of success. Second, I love the idea of ‚Äúpushing‚Äù the dice.


### Success degrees. 

In roll-under RPG systems, the exact number you rolled doesn‚Äôt matter most of the time - as long as it is less or equal than your target number, you succeeded. 
Sometimes, though, a situation arises in which two characters must compare their skills to settle a competition - Opposed rolls. 
GURPS rules describe a system for determining how many degrees of success you have on a roll. Still, it‚Äôs one of those cases where you don‚Äôt use it frequently enough, and most players end up not knowing what to do by heart: When they need it, they have to make a conscious effort to remember it, and it ends up becoming a mental bookkeeping task.
My rule of thumb for designing a system that avoids this kind of mental bookkeeping is very straightforward: ditch it or double down. 
If it doesn‚Äôt work in favor of gameplay, if it's not fun and doesn‚Äôt encourage role-playing, ditch it. If it does, though, let‚Äôs use it enough that it becomes an integral part of the game and the player‚Äôs knowledge, so much so that it stops being an afterthought and becomes more of an automatic reaction. Of course, there‚Äôs a limit to how many different rules someone can easily learn by heart, so if I‚Äôm to double down on rules, there better be consistency among them. 

At this point, I‚Äôm really liking the idea of using a blackjack system. 

To draw a comparison, in BlackJack, the players draw cards or roll dice, trying to add up as close as possible to the target value of 21 without going over. If you exceed the target value, you lose - the player who gets closer to the target value (without exceeding) wins.

It fits naturally on a roll under system:
For simple skill checks, things stay the same: any number lesser or equal to your skill level works. But it greatly simplify opposed rolls: whoever gets the higher number (without exceeding their skill value) wins. To double down in the idea that ‚Äúhigher is better‚Äù but only up to your skill level, I could have critical success be triggered when you roll your exact skill level (instead of a number lower than 4).

In a blackjack system like this, the character‚Äôs skill level effectively acts as a cap on how good their rolls can be in a contest (and also as a tie breaker in case both players fail in an opposed roll).

As another way of ‚Äúdoubling down‚Äù, I‚Äôm also thinking about making more resolutions work as opposed rolls - maybe combat can be done based on opposed rolls and success margins?


### Pushing your luck

I don‚Äôt know exactly which system introduced the idea of letting the players ‚Äúpush their luck,‚Äù but I first saw it on the Free League titles. It allows the player to exchange ‚Äúsomething‚Äù for a chance to roll the dice again. Which ‚Äúsomething‚Äù? Some systems have a specific ‚Äúluck‚Äù pool that keeps track of how many times the player can do it. Others just let the player trade a hit point for a re-roll. 
My idea here ties back to what I said about casino games earlier: I think it can be an exciting opportunity for an in-game high stakes moment, where the ‚Äúpushing‚Äù mechanism acts like a bet that the player can put. I‚Äôm still figuring out what exactly that would mean mechanic and rule-wise in my experiment, but I‚Äôm playing around with some concepts:
- Since I'm settled on using three dice, Maybe it could be fun to have a ‚Äúpoker‚Äù twist and let the user chooses between re-rolling just one or two dice? Question: Does that have a different ‚Äúcost‚Äù?
- Can the ‚Äúcost‚Äù be set so that it stimulates role play? One idea I have here is having the user to develop a creative description of what they‚Äôre doing differently as a requirement for re-rolling. The GM would be allowed to deny the request: ‚ÄúI will try harder‚Äù is not a valid reason. The whole purpose is to get the players to be creative and add fun opportunities, hooks that the GM can use, and color to the story... The obvious problem here is that this is too open for interpretation; additionally, I also don‚Äôt know if this exact mechanism would be fun for the players. But it's certainly worth investigating.
