For a long time I’ve been a RPG aficionado - I played many different games both as a character and as a game master, I participated in conferences, wrote countless homebrew systems and rules, helped translate GURPS supplements to my native idiom (in an informal capacity). But then I just stopped. Life events, new friendships… A 25 year hiatus until I was recently reintroduced to the hobby and I’ve been fascinated by learning about epverything that happened in these years - from new concepts & systems to entirely new branches of RPGs… I find even business histories (like the D&D 4 flop and the emergence of PathFinder) to be entertaining. 
I have been playing many “new” games and systems, from Fate to D&D 5 to Numera, Apocalypse world, Cortex Prime... I loved to learn about all sorts of new mechanics introduced in these years. So for no reason other than my own entertainment and curiosity, I started playing around with the idea of making a new generic role playing system, inspired by GURPS.
